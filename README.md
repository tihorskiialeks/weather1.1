# weather1 application using provider 
The application has three pages: 
- home page, where you can see the weather in the chosen city;
- search page, where you put the name of the city;
- settings page, where you can choose units of measurements (Celsius / Fahrenheit);

The theme of the app depends on the temperature of the chosen city. If it`s higher than 20 degrees of Celsius, the app has the light theme, 
otherwise dark theme. 

During learning the topic I made mind map for better understanding. It is in this folder: weather with provider Mind map.jpeg
 
For creating application openweathermap.org service was used. 

Data was obtained in JSON format and was used to create the model of the weather.
